# Remote Work Data Analysis (2-Year Study)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a two-year dataset on remote work to identify trends, differences, and outcomes across work types, industries, and time. The goal is to generate clear, evidence-based insights and present them through a shared interactive dashboard.

The analysis focuses on **what changed over time, how remote work compares to other work types, and why these patterns matter for decision-making**.

---

## Workflow & Contributions
- All team members contribute to **data exploration, cleaning, and analysis**
- Each analysis task is documented in a **separate notebook**
- Raw data is never modified directly
- Cleaning decisions and assumptions are clearly stated
- Insights are validated before inclusion in the dashboard

---

## Key Analysis Themes
- Remote vs hybrid vs onsite work
- Trends over the two-year period
- Industry and role-level differences
- Productivity, satisfaction, and related outcomes

---

## Dashboard
The final dashboard presents validated insights from the analysis in an interactive format.
