# Remote Work Survey Dashboard

This project turns a complex employee survey into a clear, decision-ready story.
It answers a simple business question: what do employees want from remote work, and where do organizations fall short?

---

## Why this matters
Remote work policies affect productivity, retention, and cost. This dashboard helps leaders see:
- who is working remotely,
- how preferences differ from reality,
- what support employees feel they have,
- and where time is gained or lost.

## What the app shows (in plain language)
**Overview**
Who the respondents are and what industries they represent.

**Demographics**
How remote work differs by age, gender, company size, and location.

**Remote Work**
The gap between what happened and what people wanted -- before COVID, during COVID, and looking ahead.

**Org Support**
Whether employees feel supported to work remotely, and how their time shifts between commuting, work, and personal life.

## Why a recruiter should care
This is a demonstration of judgment, not just a dashboard.
- I started with messy survey data and made it reliable.
- I chose the minimum number of charts to tell the story clearly.
- I built a product that non-technical users can understand and act on.

---

## How it was built (short and simple)
- Cleaned and standardized raw survey data in Python
- Explored patterns with EDA
- Built an interactive Dash app with filters and KPIs
- Designed for clarity and speed, not complexity

## Who is this project for?
1. Individuals dealing with large volumes of data which can't be handled with traditional tools.
2. Employers curious to learn about general perception towards remote work.
3. Students of statistics curious to learn how statistical tools are applied in real life.
